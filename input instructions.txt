# "input.txt" is read for creating the Planet
# lines beginng with a hastag will be ignored(all lines with leading or trailing whitespace will be trimmed)
# each line creates a planet with the numbers in the line(seperated with spaces) as parameters following this format:
# (x position) (y position) (x velocity, set to 0 if no input) (y velocity, set to 0 if no input) (mass, set to 100 if no input)
# or if you want to randomly generated a parameter put: random(min,max) to generate a random value with the provided range
# if you want to do a bunch of the same planet(using random will result in different random parameters for each planet), start of the line with the word "bunch" and the amount of planets(divided by a space), then with the standard parameters for a single planet
# examples:


# generate 10 planets with random positions on the screen(dimensions are 600x600) with random velocities all with the default mass
bunch 10 random(0,600) random(0,600) random(-100,100) random(-100,100) 100

# generate a planet in the center of the screen with a random large mass

300 300 0 0 random(2000,3000)
